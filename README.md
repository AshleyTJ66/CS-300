What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I was asked to create a program that would print course information and schedule samples to help the Computer Science advisors for ABCU.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data Structures are important because data structures all present in every day life without us realizing. Using data structures was easier to utilize than having to repeat the coding throughtout the process causing the down time to be less than if I utilize a different approach. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I had a problem with the coding not compiling properly but after removing an unneeded HPP file that I include it was able to compile but not completely run.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The project definitely challenged me to change the way I interpret programming and how I produce my own programs. The algorithms that were learned throughtout this course was helping when it came to producing programs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The project at hand has to be one of the more challenging programs that I have created thus far. Programming this program has tested my mindset many times throught this course. In the atmosphere of coding, having adaptable, readable and maintainable programs are important. Finishing this project and the course has pushed me to work on being more detailed and vigilant with my programming.
